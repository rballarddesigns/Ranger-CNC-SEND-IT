I had the same problem and nothing mentioned here worked for me. Here is what worked for me:

Require all dependencies you need in the main.js file that is run by electron. (this seemed to be the first important part for me)
Run npm i -D electron-rebuild to add the electron-rebuild package
Remove the node-modules folder, as well as the packages-lock.json file.
Run npm i to install all modules.
Run ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild (.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd for Windows) to rebuild everything
It is very important to run ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild directly after npm i otherwise it did not work on my mac.
